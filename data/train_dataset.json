And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?\nUser: My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption.\nSystem: Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies!

That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore.\nUser: I think I have heard of it but don't know the story.

He was a very interesting guy. Seeing the film might make the kids get into him.\nUser: That is true. I think Tom hanks will do a good job in that one.\nSystem: Yeah. If you like Hanks and want something for the kids thats not too long, then this is the one. Reviews were great too.\nUser: Thank you for your recommendation. I will choose Mr Rogers.",

The documentary is called Shoah.\nUser: That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting.

The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians.\nUser: That sounds really interesting!

It made me think about the character in a different way.\nUser: That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion.\nSystem: You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing! And if you have not seen the first one yet, Spider-Man Homecoming, make sure to give that a watch first!\nUser: Will do thanks. Have a good day.\nSystem: Thanks, you as well!\nUser: Oh,is Spider-Man Homecoming the newest ones. Looks like there have been multipule Spiderman movies in the past fifteen years.\nSystem: Yes, Spider-man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home are the newest versions. Tom Holland plays Spiderman in these movies and they are a part of the ongoing Marvel cinematic universe, which is why this Spiderman was in the recent Avengers movie that you mentioned!\nUser: Oh, good. Thank makes sense. I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time.\nSystem: That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times! There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison.\nUser: Ok, I think I have heard of that too. Spider Gwen is in it. I will check that out too!",

Do you want to watch something similar to that?\nUser: Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind?\nSystem: So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary?\nUser: Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's?\nSystem: Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime?\nUser: Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?\nSystem: I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies?\nUser: I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster.\nSystem: I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that?\nUser: OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself?\nSystem: How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these?\nUser: They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites?",

I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that?\nUser: I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?\nSystem: I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise!\nUser: I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look.

Really good flick.\nSystem: That sounds really interesting. Is that the type of movie you would like to see a trailer on today?\nUser: That would be great. Its hard to find a decent horror movie these days.\nSystem: I know what you mean. The lead in that was also on American Idol, which is a neat trivia tidbit!\nUser: Wow thats crazy lol.\nSystem: I was thinking of a trailer that I thought might fit your interests.\nUser: Lay it on me, let's see what you got.\nSystem: LOL! I was curious if you liked the psychological aspect or just straight up horror more?\nUser: I like both, but I think I'd like straight up horror more.\nSystem: I was thinking about Haunt and the younger cast and a movie with a bit of twist.\nUser: That sounds exactly like what I would like. The tough part is finding a good one.\nSystem: I think this one might be worth a shot if you are ready?\nUser: Yep I'm ready.",

It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing.\nUser: I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations.\nSystem: Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys.\nUser: Wow, i definitely find that interesting, what is the plot about? How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others?\nSystem: Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys.\nUser: That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation!\nSystem: No problem. Hope you enjoy it!\nUser: I will, by chance do you know of any other movies that involve drama?\nSystem: Yes, there's quite a few. If you want drama and action, I would recommend the Jason Bourne series. Matt Damon does a good job of balancing both the action and drama as he finds out about his past.\nUser: What other notable actor's and actress's are on the Jason Bourne Series?\nSystem: There's Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and instead of Matt Damon the fourth movie in the series The Bourne Legacy stars Jeremy Renner.\nUser: That is pretty awesome, is enjoy movies like that. I mainly watch movies about Native Americans, do you know of any movies similar to something like that?",

I get tired of watching movies that have the same concepts but with different actors.\nSystem: I've heard of that movie, with Robin Williams. I have it on my list of movies I want to see. Your husband will enjoy Sully. It's a movie you can watch parts of over and over, because of the tension and drama of landing the plane.\nUser: I will check out the trailer for the movie. Do you have any other recommendations? I worry about the movie being about landing a plane only because my husband was in the military and has some ptsd so I have to be careful with what we watch. He doesn't do well with military, helicopters, war or planes.\nSystem: Maybe a non-action drama would be better. I highly recommend Spotlight about The Boston Globe and their investigative efforts. No action, just people working hard.\nUser: Thank you I am sure that we both would enjoy that movie. Thank you for your help I feel good about that movie it sounds very interesting and something the whole family can enjoy.\nSystem: I have selected Spotlight on the left. It shows some details about it.\nUser: I will definitely check it out. thank you for your help. is there any other movie you would suggest.\nSystem: Another investigative movie is'Truth about CBS News.\nUser: he does enjoy his news. can you go into more detail about the plot of the movie.\nSystem: It's about when Dan Rather was the evening news anchor, and they were investigating George Bush (Jr.), and they believed a man who gave them information, but who wasn't totally trustworthy.\nUser: what year was the movie made?\nSystem: It was released in 2015.\nUser: oh wow Im surprised that we havent watched it yet. because hes really big on politics and news. this sounds like another great option.",

If your interested in comedies theres a new movie called knifed out that is critically acclaimed.\nUser: I saw a trailer for it, i think. What's it about? It has some big stars, doesn't it?\nSystem: Yea the film has big stars in it. Basically the film is a mix of murder mystery, crime, thriller, with heavy aspects of comedy. Overall the comedy offsets the cime aspect of the film making it a fun watch. Overall the film is about a family where a murder takes place and the cast tries to solve who was murdered. Without spoilers thats how much I can really go into.\nUser: Sounds good...Knives Out, though, not Knifed. I think my wife wanted to see it.\nSystem: Correct, I apologize for the misspelling.

It reminded me of my experience watching John Wick 3.\nUser: Oh, that is the greatest of all lately, I enjoy watching it over again.\nSystem: Are you looking for a movie that has a similar story to any of these films we've talked about?\nUser: I won't mind if I get one or two from you.\nSystem: If you enjoyed John Wick, I would recommend a movie called The Raid 2. It's a foreign film with a very similar storyline to John Wick and has earned many accolades.\nUser: That is great, I will add that to my cart now and see that movie soonest.",

It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast.\nUser: What is the movie (The King) about??\nSystem: The story is about Hal, son of King Henry, who is a wayward prince and he reluctantly becomes King after his father passes away.

I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres.\nSystem: Those are my favorites too!

While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher.

And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!\nUser: Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?\nSystem: The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!\nUser: Thanks for that information.

I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently.\nSystem: Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it?\nUser: Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway.\nSystem: I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it?\nUser: I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood.\nSystem: Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie?\nUser: No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire.\nSystem: I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!\nUser: Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?\nSystem: He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies!\nUser: I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good.\nSystem: Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?\nUser: Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers.\nSystem: I did! Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow? I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow!

It's very imaginative, creative and awe inspiring.\nUser: What is it about?\nSystem: I don't remember exactly. The humans have inhabited a new planet populated by blue skinned giants. They've developed a technology to suit themselves to conform into their culture and they explore a new world and make friends with the people.\nUser: And what is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk about?\nSystem: I actually don't have the trailer for that. Here's the Google results. When young farmhand Jack (Nicholas Hoult) unwittingly opens a portal between his realm and a race of giants, it rekindles an ancient war. Roaming Earth for the first time in centuries, the fearsome giants seek to reclaim the land they lost long ago. Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself.\nUser: Well, avatar would be okay then.\nSystem: It's a good movie for the kids if they like animated beings and stuff. Also, what's the animated movie with the parents that have super powers, and their kids have them too?\nUser: I don't know.",

There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive).

Anyway, back to Doctor Sleep, are you a fan of the cast (Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Furguson) or are you just interested in the story?\nUser: i like the cast and the story seems interesting so ill probably go see it.\nSystem: Cool, i haven't seen it yet either, but i intend to. There's just too many things coming out recently for me to keep up.\nUser: same, so many options so little tie.\nSystem: Honestly, I'm running out of things to say lol, but they won't let me leave yet. So...I'm especially looking forward to Ewan McGregor's performance, i really like him as an actor and I think he'll excel in this role.\nUser: same here, you know any other good movies out right now?",

Puppets freak me out haha Now puppies on the other hand, I can deal with that.\nSystem: What was the last movie you watched?\nUser: A movie called Hush, it's about a deaf woman who is fighting off a man who is trying to kill her. Kind of a Slasher movie.\nSystem: Did you like Scream?\nUser: This may sound crazy, but I've never seen Scream. I've heard it's good though, and it sounds like a movie I would like.\nSystem: I like Scream the plots of all the movies keep twisting.\nUser: It sounds interesting!

Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent.\nSystem: that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now?\nUser: Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies.\nSystem: oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it.\nUser: I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend?\nSystem: of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it?\nUser: I am not, though I like tom cruise movies.\nSystem: this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about).\nUser: Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets?\nSystem: yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt.\nUser: lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others?\nSystem: looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis.\nUser: I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that?\nSystem: cant mention time travel assassins without bringing up terminator or terminator 2...a real interesting take on the action/futuristic space genre is hardcore henry, the entire movie is shot first person.\nUser: Oh, I hadn't thought of looking back that far. I'll check out both terminator and terminator 2. I accept your recommendation.",

And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!\nUser: I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?\nSystem: I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?\nUser: Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?",

I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect.\nUser: If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies.\nSystem: Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy!\nUser: I prefer original DVD's rather than streaming or downloadable mediums.\nSystem: Same! Not too many people like us out there anymore! I really hope you enjoy your movie watching :).\nUser: Oh that is for sure. The local shop I buy CD's and records from is where I purchase most of my DVDs, and I also enjoy VHS tapes.\nSystem: That's awesome! I'm the same way and loveeee VHS tapes too. I'm so bummed my VCR broke a few months ago and finding a brand new one at a decent price is surprisingly difficult.

What did you like about the Joker?\nSystem: even though it was a super hero character, it was nothing like a super hero movie. it was gritty a real. it is the story of how the joker became the joker because of many bad events over his life.\nUser: So not a lot of fight scenes and big action movie stuff?\nSystem: no there are not very many fight scenes, it is mostly just about the joker himself.\nUser: That sounds interesting.\nSystem: joaquin phoenix is perfect for the role and does an amazing job acting in it.\nUser: Yes, he is a good actor. Do you know who directed it?\nSystem: yes the director was Todd Phillips.\nUser: Didn't he do the Hangover? Thats a much different film!",

What about Glass?\nSystem: Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon.\nUser: Both of those seem like movies I would be interested in. One of my favorite psychological thrillers is Shutter Island. Do you know of any movies similar to that?\nSystem: You might like Awaken, though it is a few years old. The plot is based on a random group of people waking up on an island where they are being hunted down.\nUser: Great! I will have to check that one out too.",

It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie.\nUser: Oh yeah that movie is great.\nSystem: Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige?\nUser: Not yet, but I'm intersted.\nSystem: I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you.

The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think.\nUser: Hmm, do you have another Nolan movie in mind?\nSystem: Since you like MCU movies, I'm assuming you've seen The Dark Knight trilogy, but if not I'd really recommend those even if you aren't a DC fan.\nUser: I like those movies.",

Any other actors of note in Replicas?\nSystem: me neither. a bunch of unknowns which makes it better and he tends to make those types of films anyhow. But John Ortiz has made some films for drama.\nUser: Replicas sounds great, I feel like Keanu Reeves has been everywhere recently, but I only recall seeing the him in John Wick films as of late. I'd love to see the trailer for it and check it out.\nSystem: awesome. no one would ever play john wick better than him btw. i wish they had him in deathwish rather than the other guy from die hard.\nUser: Ha, I never watched the new Deathwish. I've seen some of the originals and even those were done to death by Charles Bronson. Would be great to see Hollywood embrace more original ideas instead of drudging up established IP's because of their noteriety.\nSystem: i agree. everything is a remake. they are even trying to remake now Hitchcock's films. which we both know will ruin the films.\nUser: I recently found out they already redid Psycho a few years back, I was shocked.",

Thanks for asking!\nSystem: You are most welcome. lol :) Do you like movies and if so which genre?\nUser: I love movies. Science fiction is probably my favorite, followed by action/drama or action/thriller.\nSystem: which film have you seen recently? i love that genre also.\nUser: It's probably not the last science fiction film I've seen, but the one that comes to mind first is Blade Runner 2049.\nSystem: I love Blade Runner. Especially more older films.\nUser: Despite it's faults, I really enjoy the original Blade Runner. It has a fantastic atmosphere. Yeah, they don't make movies like they used to.\nSystem: If they had Keanu Reeves it would have been better. The main actor ruined the film. Speaking of Keanu I loved Replicas.\nUser: Yeah, Keanu Reeves is great! What is Replicas? I don't think I know that one.\nSystem: He is the main role it is similar to x-files and a mix of matrix. Cloning. i really like it and i think you would. you should check it out.\nUser: Sounds interesting.

I really think my family will love the new one!!\nSystem: Perfect! I'm happy to help, I hope you enjoy the movie and have a great day!\nUser: Thank you! i appreciate it!\nSystem: I almost forgot to mention, another great movie similar to frozen is Snow Queen! it's a family friendly movie and is a little more action based.

Do you have any specifically in mind?\nSystem: What kind of movies do you like?\nUser: I typically like dramas or comedies. Horror films can be fine too but they are sometimes more hit and miss.\nSystem: Cool, those are great genres.\nUser: Any recommendations for a good drama or comedy to watch? I've recently seen a lot of the Best Picture nominees but am looking for something else to watch.\nSystem: If your looking for a good comedy you can not go wrong with the new Will Smith and Martin Lawerence movie BAD BOYS for Life.\nUser: I've wondered about that. That's one I've hesitated to see so far, not being sure about how good it was. Any sort of drama/action movie?\nSystem: Bad Boys for life is the third installment to the very successful Bad Boys franchise. If your looking for another drama/action movie you might check out the next installment of the James Bond franchise with Daniel Craig in No Time to Die.\nUser: I've been eyeing that one before it comes out.

The rest of the family is trying to kill her, and she has to stay hidden until dawn to win. It is more of thriller with a little bit of comedy.\nUser: Is it really violent?\nSystem: No, not really. There are some deaths but nothing extreme.\nUser: I don't really think I want to watch that. I'd like more of an action movie than a thriller.",

What is the last movie you watched that you enjoyed?\nUser: The last movie I saw in a Theater was StarWars. And I see a lot of movies by platforms like Netflix. I just finished the 3 seasons of Outlander.\nSystem: My son loves the Star wars Trilogy. Netflix is great! We watch movies on there all the time.\nUser: I meant the last Starwars that was on the theaters last month.\nSystem: Oh I'm sorry. I'm not that familiar with Star Wars. My son and husband enjoy them. Have you seen any Good Boys yet?\nUser: Yes, I like Starwars too, the first trilogy was release when I was a child, then after several years they release the second part of the trilogy and this last one is like a bonus. No, I have not seen Good Boys yet. What is about?\nSystem: It's pretty funny. I watched it with my teenagers. It's about these three 12-year-old boys who get invited to their first kissing party. So they decide to do some research and spy on the teenage girls next door. You can only imagine how crazy and out of hand things go from there.\nUser: And it is on the theaters, or do you saw it in a platform?\nSystem: You can rent it on Amazon Prime, Vudu or Apple. Knives Out is at the theaters and I heard that is very funny. I have not had a chance to see it yet.\nUser: I have Amazon Prime, so I can see it. Thanks for the recommendation. Yes, I saw the trailer of Knives Out, but I believe there is some violence in there.",

I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P.\nSystem: I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.\nUser: I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different.\nSystem: It sounds like they would be if they were. I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again.\nUser: Okay cool. I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing.\nSystem: They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books.\nUser: Any luck with the link?",

Have you heard of the movie Troop Zero on Amazon Prime?\nUser: No I haven't heard of that one!\nSystem: I haven't watched that one yet, but I just added it to my Watchlist. It has Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan and Allison Janney in it. A great cast. If you're looking for a cartoon though, I think I would recommend Spies In Disguise. Did you catch that one yet?\nUser: No I haven't caught that one yet either! Troop zero is definitely going on my watch list! Cartoon is more for my family! My children are under 10 years old. I'll have to check out Spies in Disguise. I'm over watching Tangled and Zootopia over and over.",

Can't really watch them at the theaters right now.\nSystem: Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week.\nUser: Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long.\nSystem: Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting.\nUser: Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha.\nSystem: Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version.\nUser: Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/.\nSystem: 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie.\nUser: Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film?\nSystem: Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.\nUser: Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.\nSystem: Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together!\nUser: I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible!",

That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers!\nSystem: They all mix together really good, plus the dad aka the pants gets into all sorts of shenanigans and its super funny.\nUser: I have high hopes for Onward, I've never been disappointed by a Pixar film, so I expect good things.

It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography. The trailer is definitely worth a watch.\nUser: Oh, that sounds intriguing. I'd love to see that one pretty soon. I love the sound of cold war as the story-line. I think I'd love it.\nSystem: Oh awesome!\nUser: Nice one then....I think my next movie is Atomic Blonde.\nSystem: Yeah it is a great film to watch especially as I imagine you won't have much to do in the coming weeks!
